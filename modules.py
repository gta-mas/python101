# module = a file containing python code, may contain functions, classes, etc.
# used with modular programming, which is to separate a program into parts

import messages as msg        # creating an alias
# from messages import hello,bye  # another way of importing
# from messages import *          # * = imports ALL functions -> dangerous!

msg.hello()
msg.bye()
